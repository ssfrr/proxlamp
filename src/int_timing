Interrupt Durations and Calling frequency:

timer interrupt:
pulsing:
4.9us, called every 12.2us

ringing and waiting for echo:
3.4us, called every 31us

pulse counter interrupt:
1.8us, called about 2ms into a measurement, and again sometimes while receiving pulses

receive pin ext interrupt:
4us, called 2ms into measurement and 3-5 times while receiving pulses (should be around 12.2us apart)
last time it takes around 8us

zerocross interrupt:
9.1us, called 8.2ms apart for positive half of AC, 8.5ms for negative

triac timer interrupt:
1.6us, after 1.6ms, then a 2.1us pulse 100us later

General timings:

wait time for 1m object:
2m / 344m/s = 5.8ms

sensor timer period time: 2^8 / 8000000 = 32us

period count for 1m object = 5.8ms / 32us = 181.25
